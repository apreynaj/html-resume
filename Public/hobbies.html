<p>In my free time I enjoy having a cup of sleapy tea and cuddle in bed with a nice book.</p>
<p>Some of my favorites at the moment are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A Court of Thorns and Roses - Sarah J Mass</li>
    <li>The Ride of a Lifetime - Bob Iger</li>
    <li>Simple Abudance - Sarah Ban Brethnach</li>
</ul>
<h2>Baking</h2>

<p> Although I don't bake as often as I would like, I love baking bread and eating it of course.</p>
<h2>Watching Movies or Series</h2>

<p> I really enjoy watching movies or series at home. One of my favorite activities to do with my loved ones.</p>
